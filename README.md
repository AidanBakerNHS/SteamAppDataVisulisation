## Project Overview

This project will explore trends and patterns within PC video games released on Steam. A comprehensive EDA will be performed to pick out trends over the Years.

Additionally, a multi-class machine learning tool will be created to assess the viability of using the features within the dataset to predict how well users receive a game by targeting the user-review score (Self made feature, aggregating the reviews of the game into groups, i.e 'Positive,', 'Very Positive'. 'Negative' etc)

## Data Collection

### Steam API

The Steam API was used to collect data from 348,312 app's on steam

This process was completed using a Python script to automatically call the Steam API to collect this information, which was placed on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) machine to complete. The process took 2 and a half weeks due to steams strict API limits, which frequently resulted in HTTP error 429 (too many requests) imposing 5-minute timeouts.

### Steam Spy API

Once the Steam data was collected, it was determined that this dataset was lacking in features to perform a comprehensive EDA and partake in a machine learning tool.  

To resolve this Steam Spy's API was used to collect additional information using a similar Python script to append this data onto the steam data. 

Steam Spy gathers daily data from Steam regarding player numbers, providing additional information to explore, as well as to indicate any feature which hold predictive power.

Although Steam Spy's API requests we're more generous than Steams (comfortably allowing 1 request per second), non-games (software, DLC, movies) from the original SteamExport.csv dataset were excluded to cut down on the time required for the Python script to complete.

This is the final version of the dataset which will be explored, which contains 94,955 records (prior to data cleaning). The original dataset from Steam without the Steam Spy data is also linked below, but unused further in this project.

### Links to dataset

The datasets collected, are publicly available here: (Updated as of December 2024)

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

‚Ä¢ Excessive NULLs (>‚ÄØ90%)

Many of the columns (metacritic score, recommendations, score_rank and more) contain a significant number of NULLs (>90%).
Due to so little of the data for these columns existing, imputing these fields (E.g. replacing 90% of null values with an average) would have introduced distortion as opposed to insight. Instead, these columns were dropped, and only those with an acceptable number of NULLs were retained and filled.

‚Ä¢ Median vs Mean Imputation

Some columns retaining sufficient data points (player counts, playtime figures) were deemed acceptable to impute with the median value.
The choice to use the median as opposed to the mean was made to avoid outliers from skewing the data, helping to preserve the datasets natural distribution.

‚Ä¢ Mixed-Type Text Fields

In addition, the dataset contained mixed-type columns. For example, strings were a mix of HTML/BBCode, JSON and plain text, requiring the use of REGEX to clean these columns.

‚Ä¢ Estimated Owner Ranges

Finally, estimated owners were provided as a range, e.g. '5,000 - 10,000'. This string column required stripping non numerical characters and retrieving the midpoint of this range to gain a numeric value.


#### Overall, this dataset contained a wealth of valuable features that can provide predictive power to a machine learning model upon pruning, data type changes and feature engineering to support this task.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visulisations

### Bubble Visulisation of Estimated Owners per Year per Genre

### Word Cloud of Game Titles

![Word Cloud of Single Words](/Assets/WordCloud1.png)

![Word Cloud of Bi-Grams](/Assets/WordCloud2.png)

The most common single words and bigrams in Steam game titles, reflecting marketing-driven naming schemes.

### Total Releases by Year

![Released Per Year](/Assets/ReleasesPerYear.png)

![Released Per Year Per Genre](/Assets/ReleasesPerYearPerGenre.png)

Game releases begin to sharpy increase from 2013, with Action being the dominant genre throughout. A notable change is Casual becoming the second most released genre in 2024, surpassing Adventure.

### Owners vs Positive Review Percentage

![Owners vs Positive Reviews](/Assets/OwnersvsPosReviews.png)

Highly popular titles with millions of owners cluster around 70 - 95% positive reviews, whereas lower owned games experience a wider variance in positive reviews. This suggests lower owned games, perhaps more niche titles, can be hidden gems or disappointments.

### Owners vs Positive Review Percentage

![Owners vs Positive Reviews](/Assets/AvgPosReviewsPerYear.png)

High early averages from 1998 - 2008. Interestingly reviews spike up and down despite rising every other Year in this period.

There is a noticeable and sharp drop in 2008 which is stabilized in 2012.

Positive review average dropped to its lowest point in 2014 before experiencing a slight uptick after 2018.


#### The above EDA has provided valuable insights to power a machine learning model, for example a games popularity being correlated with review stability.

## Machine Learning

## Usage
